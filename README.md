# Welcome to the ClassifierAI Repository!

## Description
A Google Chrome Extension that integrates Machine Learning to determine if the image, that the user is viewing, is AI-Generated. This uses ml5.js, which is built on top of Tensorflow.js, to perform Image Classification.

(IN PROGRESS) The model is trained using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) by Google where it is train from 3000 images, that consists of AI and Non-AI images, using the following settings:
- Epochs: 3000
- Batch Size: 10
- Learning Rate: 0.001
